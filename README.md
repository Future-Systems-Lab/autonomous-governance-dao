# Autonomous Governance DAO

An **educational governance prototype** developed for **CSU Global coursework in Management Information Systems**.

This project explores **decentralized leadership**, **ethical automation**, and **governance-by-design** using immutable smart contracts as a learning model—not as an operational DAO.

It demonstrates:
- data integrity concepts  
- consent verification patterns  
- auditability and transparency  
- governance logic relevant to digital health systems

- Not deployed to mainnet  
- No active token distribution  
- No live governance operations  
- No clinical or commercial use  

All functionality is implemented strictly for **academic, research, and portfolio demonstration purposes**.
